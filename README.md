I specialize in creating applications for iOS and tvOS, along with server-side applications using Vapor. I have a strong dedication to clean code and a belief that code should not work against you, but for you.

On my blog, [kittako](https://kittako.hashnode.dev/), I share my interests and insights. It's a place where I write about what I've learned and what excites me. ðŸš€ðŸ’ª
